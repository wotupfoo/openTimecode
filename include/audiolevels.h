 * LINEAR TIME CODE (LTC)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_timecode
 * Made up of 80 bits per frame, where there may be 24, 25 or 30 frames per second, 
 * LTC timecode varies from 960 Hz (binary zeros at 24 frames/s) to 2400 Hz (binary 
 * ones at 30 frames/s), and thus is comfortably in the audio frequency range. 
 * LTC can exist as either a balanced or unbalanced signal, and can be treated as an 
 * audio signal in regards to distribution. Like audio, LTC can be distributed by 
 * standard audio wiring, connectors, distribution amplifiers, and patchbays, 
 * and can be ground-isolated with audio transformers. It can also be distributed 
 * via 75 ohm video cable and video distribution amplifiers, although the voltage 
 * attenuation caused by using a 75 ohm system may cause the signal to drop to a 
 * level that can not be read by some equipment.

 * Mic Level = (2 millivolts)
 * Line Level (pro) = +4db (1.23 volts)
 * Line Level (consumer) = -10db. (.316 volts)

 * A line input level electrical signal typically has a voltage 
 * ranging from 0,3 to 2 Volts, while a microphone level signal 
 * is more often in the range from 5 to 50 mV (millivolts). 
 * Microphone sensitivities range from -60 dBu to -22 dBu referenced 
 * to 94 dB Soud Pressure Level (0 dB SPL = 2*10â€“5N/m2).
 * The consumer line input level electrical signal typically has a 
 * voltage of 0,32 V (-7,8 dBu), whilst the professional line input 
 * level is typically 1,23 V (+4 dBu).
